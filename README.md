we undertook a detailed analysis to understand the factors influencing the Valence metric in Spotify, which quantifies the happiness or positivity conveyed by a track. The project involved a multifaceted approach starting with the extraction and merging of data from Spotify's API, focusing on various audio features such as danceability, energy, loudness, and more. We utilized inferential statistical methods to identify the most significant features contributing to Valence. Furthermore, we employed machine learning techniques, including at least three different models, to predict Valence based on these features. The models were meticulously tuned through hyperparameter optimization to achieve the best performance. The final model evaluation was conducted using a holdout testing dataset, with performance measured by the Mean Absolute Error (MAE). This project provided valuable insights into the relationship between audio features and perceived happiness in music, as well as hands-on experience with data processing, statistical analysis, and machine learning model development.
